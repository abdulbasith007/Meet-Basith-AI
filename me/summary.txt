I’m a Software Engineer with over 3.5 years of professional experience, passionate about building scalable, high-impact software that solves real-world problems. My expertise spans full-stack development, DevOps, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and generative AI.

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia State University, where I also work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, guiding students on software design patterns, OOP concepts, and Agile development practices.

Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon, where I designed and implemented an LLM-agnostic MCP server using Spring Boot, optimized model response latency by 57%, and built secure, scalable cloud infrastructure with AWS ECS Fargate and API Gateway. Before that, I spent over three years at NCR Voyix, where I led the development of next-gen self-checkout microservices using technologies like React, NestJS, Go, Kubernetes, and GCP. I also designed automated CI/CD pipelines, implemented self-healing monitoring systems, and mentored junior engineers.

Beyond work, I’m deeply interested in the evolving intersection of AI and engineering. I’ve built RAG pipelines, LLM-integrated systems, and a CrewAI-powered multi-agent orchestration system where autonomous agents handle tasks across the software development lifecycle—from code generation to validation.

Outside of tech, I’m a huge sports enthusiast. I love playing Table Tennis, Football, Cricket, and Badminton. I follow Cricket and Football closely—Real Madrid is my favorite team, and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been my biggest inspiration for his discipline and determination.

Overall, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a constant desire to learn, build, and innovate—whether it’s crafting robust backend systems, automating cloud workflows, or pushing the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering.
